# VPN Project

This project requires an Android SDK for building and running tests. Gradle looks for the SDK location in the `local.properties` file at the project root. Ensure that `local.properties` defines the `sdk.dir` property before attempting to build or test.

Example:

```
sdk.dir=/path/to/android/sdk
```

Replace the path with the installation directory of your Android SDK. If the file does not exist, create it with the appropriate entry.
